<h2>The story</h2>

<p class="one">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p> 

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that's too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn't that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>

<p><blockquote class="quote">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad - because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune. Alan Watts</p></blockquote><br><br>

      <td>Lose a horse</td>
      <td>Maybe</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Win more horses</td>
      <td>Maybe</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Son injury</td>
      <td>Maybe</td>

   <tr>
      <td>Avoid war</td>
      <td>Maybe</td>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p><acronym title="What does Good mean?"><a class="good" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/good" target="_blank">good</a></acronym> and <acronym title="What does Bad mean?"><a class="bad" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bad" target="_blank">bad</a></acronym> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
